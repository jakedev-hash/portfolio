      “In my recent projects, I explored data analysis and machine learning by building two tools. The first was a stock price prediction model leveraging Python and the YFinance library. It retrieves historical stock data, applies linear regression, and forecasts future prices with visualized trends. The second project focused on sentiment analysis using a custom-trained VADER model. By fine-tuning VADER’s sentiment scoring with targeted datasets, I developed a tool to analyze and quantify sentiment more accurately for specialized applications. These projects showcase practical applications of data science and demonstrate my ability to build solutions for real-world problems.”
