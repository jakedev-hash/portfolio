      <p className="text-block3-text">

      Enthusiastic programmer with a passion for front-end development and machine learning. I enjoy creating impactful solutions and exploring new technologies. I thrive in structured environments with clear guidelines and prefer working independently to take full ownership of my projects. My interests span across programming, sciences, building things, and sports, reflecting my hands-on and problem-solving mindset. I approach challenges analytically, stepping back to reassess and experimenting with new strategies to find effective solutions. Driven by competition and the excitement of calculated risks, I am motivated to deliver results that make a meaningful impact.
